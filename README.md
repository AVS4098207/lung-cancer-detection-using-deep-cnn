This repository deals with the detection of lung cancer nodules in the CT scan images using deep convolutional neural network. The corresponding outputs, dataset and the documents and the google colab codes are available within the repository. 

Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. However, the early detection of lung cancer significantly improves survival rate. Cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign) pulmonary nodules are the small growths of cells inside the lung. Detection of malignant lung nodules at an early stage is necessary for the crucial prognosis. Early-stage cancerous lung nodules are very much similar to noncancerous nodules and need a differential diagnosis on the basis of slight morphological changes, locations, and clinical biomarkers. The proposed model consists of three stages which include the visualization of the dataset, applying watershed image segmentation, feature extraction, training the models and classification. The model consists of Luna16 dataset which has around 1000 patient details consisting of all the information, which gets segmented and the image generated is used as the input. Thus, the intention of the proposed work is to classify the cancerous and non-cancerous CT images and to provide with an accurate model.
